# Week 05 Notes

- **Mounting Encoders**: It's preferable to mount the encoder on the wheels rather than the motors. This ensures more accurate readings since it directly measures the wheel’s rotation and not just the motor’s output, which may vary due to slippage or mechanical inefficiencies.

- **Sensor Placement**: Proper sensor placement is crucial. Different sensors can provide varying data depending on where they are installed on the system. Ensure that the sensors are mounted in optimal locations based on the type of data required.

- **Environmental Factors**: The environment can influence sensor data. Consider factors like temperature, humidity, and vibration when planning the sensor setup to avoid skewed results.

- **Data Cleaning**: Sensor data may often require preprocessing or cleaning to remove noise or outliers before analysis.

- **Programming Language**: The choice of programming language typically depends on the microcontroller's architecture. Common languages and frameworks used in robotics include ROS, C++, MATLAB.

## What is ROS (Robot Operating System)?

A flexible framework used for writing software for robots. It provides tools, libraries, and conventions to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a variety of platforms.
