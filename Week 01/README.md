# Introduction to Robotics

- A robot is a reprogrammable, multi-functional manipulator desiged to move material, parts, toold, or specialized devices for ths performance of various tasks.
- Two very important parts that robots mush have are Controllers and Sensors.
- Other parts include encoders, manipulators, effector and motor.

## Controller

- Brain of the robot.
- Processes the code that we write into commands that the robot follows and processes any data and feedback the robot collects.
- The heart of the robotâ€™s controller is generally a microprocessor linked to input/output and monitoring devices.

## Manipulator

- Set of links connected through hinges or joints that allows relative motions between two consecutive links.
- Basically, it is the arm-like structure in robots.

## Teach pendant

- A control box for programming the motions of a robot.
- Also called a "teach box," the robot is set to "learning" or "teach" mode, and the pendant is used to control the robot step by step.

## What is robotics?

- Study of robots, auonomous embodied systems interacting with the physical world.
- It addresses perception, interaction and action in the physical world.

## Robotic Systems

- **Body:** Mechanical Parts
- **Sensors:** Allow the perception of the world
- **Effectors and Actuators:** Used for action in the world (locomotion and manipulation)
- **Controllers for the above systems**: Coordinating information from sensors with commands for the robot's actuators.
